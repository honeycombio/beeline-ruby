    # Instruments AWS clients with Honeycomb events.
    #
    # This plugin is automatically added to any aws-sdk client class your app
    # uses. It uses {SdkHandler} to wrap a Honeycomb span around each
    # invocation of a client object method. Within that span, there is
    # typically at least one actual HTTP API call to Amazon, so each API call
    # is wrapped in a separate span by {ApiHandler}.
    #
    # This plugin adds the following options which you can use to configure
    # your aws-sdk clients:
    #
    # * `:honeycomb` - Boolean indicating whether to enable Honeycomb
    #   instrumentation. Defaults to `true`.
    #
    # * `:honeycomb_client` - Allows you to set a custom Honeycomb client
    #   object. Defaults to the global {Honeycomb.client}.
    #
    # @example Disable the Honeycomb AWS integration globally.
    #   Aws.config.update(honeycomb: false)
    #
    # @example Disable the Honeycomb AWS integration locally.
    #   s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(honeycomb: false)
    #
    # @example Use a different client globally.
    #   Aws.config.update(honeycomb_client: custom)
    #
    # @example Use a different client locally.
    #   dynamodb = Aws::DynamoDB::Client.new(honeycomb_client: custom)

    # operations. However, this doesn't mean that each method results in only

    # operation in a span, {ApiHandler} wraps the individual API requests in
    # separate child spans.
    #
    # {Plugin} accomplishes this by adding {ApiHandler} as close to sending as
    # possible, before the client retries requests, follows redirects, or even
    # parses out response errors. That way, a new span is created for every
    # literal HTTP request. But it also means we have to take care to propagate
    # error information to the span correctly, since the stock AWS error
    # handlers are upstream from this one.

      # Runs a limited subset of response parsing for AWS-specific errors.

      # Because XML/JSON error handlers are inserted at priority 50 of the
      # :sign step, they're upstream from {ApiHandler} (at priority 39), so we
      # won't have access to the error saved in Seahorse::Client::Response yet.
      # We only have the error in the Seahorse::Client::Http::Response object.
      # But Seahorse::Client::NetHttp::Handler only triggers an HTTP response
      # error for rescued exceptions (e.g., timeouts). We might still get back
      # successful HTTP 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx responses that should be interpreted
      # as aws-api errors.
      #
      # So we have to duplicate the logic of either Aws::Xml::ErrorHandler or
      # Aws::Json::ErrorHandler depending on which one is being used by the
      # current client. We can determine this by their "protocol" metadata.
      #
      # Note that there are still a few straggling errors that might occur from
      # HTTP 2xx responses. Since those aren't really API call failures, we
      # won't worry about parsing them out for the aws-api span. Once the
      # upstream handlers process those errors, they'll be propagated to the
      # aws-sdk span anyway (since {SdkHandler} will actually have access to
      # the Seahorse::Client::Response#error).

      # This error is normally caught upstream by stock plugins that trigger a

# Add the plugin to all aws-sdk client classes.

# class individually. For example, say we required aws-sdk-s3 before loading
# honeycomb-beeline. Then Aws::S3::Client would have already been defined
# without knowing about our plugin. So adding Honeycomb::Aws::Plugin to just
# Seahorse::Client::Base is insufficent. We have to call
# Aws::S3::Client.add_plugin as well.
#
# This loop will still add the plugin to Seahorse::Client::Base, which covers
# us if/when any future aws-sdk client classes get defined.
#
# This loop will *not* patch any instances of client objects that were created
# prior to loading honeycomb-beeline. While we could loop through
# ObjectSpace.each_object(Seahorse::Client::Base), it's much more awkward to
# reinitialize an existing instance. E.g., at the time the client instance was
# created, its configuration wouldn't have responded to the options defined by
# Honeycomb::Aws::Plugin, so we can't retroactively configure the plugin. In
# practice, this probably isn't a big deal: you'll likely load aws-sdk +
# honeycomb-beeline via bundler before ever instantiating an AWS client object.
