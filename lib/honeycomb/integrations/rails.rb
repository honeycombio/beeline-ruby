    # This is based on ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet#recognize_path, which
    # reconstructs an ActionDispatch::Request using a given HTTP method + path
    # by making a mock Rack environment. Here, instead of taking the method +
    # path from input parameters, we use the original values from the actual
    # incoming request (prior to any mangling that may have been done by
    # middleware).
    #
    # The resulting ActionDispatch::Request instance is suitable for passing to
    # ActionDispatch::Journey::Router#recognize to get the original Rails
    # routing information corresponding to the incoming request.
    #
    # @param request [ActionDispatch::Request]
    #   the actual incoming Rails request
    #
    # @return [ActionDispatch::Request]
    #   a simplified version of the incoming request that retains the original
    #   routing information, but nothing else (e.g., no HTTP parameters)
    #
    # @return [nil]
